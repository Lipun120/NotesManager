This project is a **text-based Notes Manager** developed in Core Java that allows users to write notes and store them permanently in a text file. It uses `FileWriter` in append mode to ensure existing notes are preserved, while `BufferedReader` reads and displays all saved notes line-by-line. A simple `if-else` based menu enables users to add notes, view notes, or exit the program. Running entirely in the console, it is lightweight, easy to use, and serves as a clear demonstration of basic file handling and user interaction in Java.
